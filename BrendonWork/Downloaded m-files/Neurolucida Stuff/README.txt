Michi Shape Plot

By this small Matlab script it is possible to graphically render the
morphological data available in a *.ASC NeuroLucida ascii file. It is
then possible to manipulate it and convert it to a variety of vectorized
file format, such as encapsulated postscript.

The program at the moment would probably not work with 3D morphologies and
it needs some very minor modification to work with *.ASC Neurolucida ascii
data files. In fact, it has been developed to work with a simplified, though
compatible file format, produced by Michi Tracer (an interactive tool for the
quantitative reconstruction of the morphology of cultured neurons).


Enjoy!
